   # The controller holds connections up to 60s for blocking invokes, and
   # all other operations are expected to complete quickly. We allow a grace
   # period in addition to the blocking invoke timeout.

  # Even though stats keeping overhead is small,
  # for maximum performance switch off when not needed.

  # The time after which an idle connection will be automatically closed.

  # This must be greater than the request timeout.
